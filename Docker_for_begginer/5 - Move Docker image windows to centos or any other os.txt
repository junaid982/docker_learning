STEP-BY-STEP: Transfer Docker Image from Windows to CentOS Server


 Assumptions
Docker image is built on Windows: e.g., mydjangoapp

CentOS server IP: 192.168.0.114 (adjust as needed)

You can SSH into the CentOS server

You want to run the image on port 8013





Step 1: Save the Docker image to a file on Windows

In Command Prompt or PowerShell, run:


>>> docker save -o mydjangoapp.tar mydjangoapp




Step 2: Transfer the image file to CentOS


Step 3: Load the Docker image from .tar file on CentOS

>>> docker load -i /root/mydjangoapp.tar

You should see output like:

Loaded image: mydjangoapp:latest



 Step 4: Run the Docker image on CentOS


>>> docker run -d -p 8013:8013 --name django_container mydjangoapp


-d = Detached Mode
Runs the container in the background.

You won't see the container logs in the terminal.

Useful when you want your app running continuously without locking the terminal.

Example:

>>> docker run -d mydjangoapp

Runs mydjangoapp in background. You can check it with:

>>> docker ps


-p = Port Mapping
Maps a host port (your machine) to a container port (inside Docker).

Syntax: -p <host_port>:<container_port>

Example:
bash
Copy
Edit
docker run -p 8013:8013 mydjangoapp





Now the app is running on:


http://192.168.0.114:8013
